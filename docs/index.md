## Organization

The main components of the software are divided into two different frames:
+ [Run Data](pages/Run Data/Run Data.html) - the core section where the input data can be selected.
+ [Histogram Display Preview](pages/Histogram Display Preview/Histogram Display Preview.html) - accessory display where the images created by the simulation can be seen previous to being saved in the excel file. This makes it easier to run different periods of time and analyze the outputs.
